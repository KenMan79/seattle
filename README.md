# [ARCHIVED] ProtoSchool Seattle Chapter


*******************************

### THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE AND HAS BEEN ARCHIVED.

This repo has been archived as part of the transition to ProtoSchool's new local event leadership model, [announced](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/84) in March of 2020. If this group is still hosting ProtoSchool workshops, they'll be listed on our events page.

**Please visit our [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) to find upcoming workshops near you** and learn more about the groups hosting them. 

**Learn more about [hosting events](https://proto.school/#/host)** under our new model, which makes it easier than ever for newcomers to start hosting ProtoSchool workshops based on our interactive [tutorials](https://proto.school/#/tutorials).

*********************************

## Welcome to ProtoSchool Seattle! :evergreen_tree::evergreen_tree::mount_fuji::umbrella:

Learning **decentralized web** protocols? Want to meet an awesome group of like-minded people and explore the decentralized web? Join us at the next learning event or talk– or [propose a talk/workshop of your own](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/seattle/issues/new/choose)!

**[Find us on our Meetup!](https://www.meetup.com/ProtoSchool-Seattle-Learn-to-Make-the-Decentralized-Web)**

Our main focus is on decentralized web protocols and tools from [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) (IPFS, IPLD, LibP2P, Multiformat, Filecoin, etc.)

This community is open to everyone. Together we can accelerate the growth of the decentralized web.
