# Title of talk

A short description of the talk. The goal should be to explain to people WHY this topic is interesting and HOW it will help them learn decentralized web protocols and tools. 1-2 paragraphs is fine. Please avoid the content like product pitches or vendor driven talk. 

Include a short bio--anything that gives us an idea of why you're interested to speak on this subject. Feel free to include any relevant links, especially to a video of you speaking if you have one.
